            <p>
              My name is <strong>_________</strong>. I’m a Telecommunication Engineering graduate with ~6 years of experience
              across telco, broadcasting operations, and ICT solution presales.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started as a <strong>Network QA Analyst at Celcom</strong>, where I built dashboards and performed structured
              analysis to improve network performance and reliability. After that, I joined <strong>Astro Radio</strong> as a
              Broadcast Operation Engineer, where I supported mission-critical systems during On Air, troubleshot issues fast,
              and handled server migration and hardening based on security benchmarks.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I’m a <strong>Senior Solution Executive</strong> doing presales work—gathering requirements, proposing
              ICT/security solutions (firewalls, NAS, CCTV, access control, licensing), preparing tender/proposal documentation,
              and coordinating with vendors and internal teams to deliver workable solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m now targeting ORLIG’s IT Presales Specialist role because it matches what I enjoy most:
              <strong>validating systems before demos, preparing structured demo data, producing clear documentation</strong>,
              and supporting presales teams to deliver confident, smooth presentations.
            </p>

            <p><em>Close:</em> I’m excited to learn ORLIG’s CRM/CX platform and contribute with strong testing discipline, documentation, and client-facing support.</p>

              <li>ORLIG focuses on Enterprise CRM/CX across industries like banking/insurance/healthcare/aviation—high impact, structured workflows.</li>
              <li>The role combines testing, setup, documentation, and demo enablement—exactly the strengths I’ve built across operations + presales.</li>

              This role supports presales by making sure the demo system is <strong>stable, correct, and tailored</strong> to the prospect.
              Key responsibilities include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>System Testing & QA:</strong> validate functions and catch bugs early so demos run smoothly.</li>
              <li><strong>System Setup & Data Prep:</strong> configure the system and load meaningful, industry-based demo data.</li>
              <li><strong>UI Mock Screens:</strong> create simple mockups to illustrate UI/flow improvements when needed.</li>
              <li><strong>Videos:</strong> create/update short product/solution videos and maintain a presales library.</li>
              <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> meeting minutes, proposals, technical write-ups, organized repository.</li>
              <li><strong>Tender support:</strong> compile RFP/RFI/RFQ documents for timely submission.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The outcome is: presales consultants can focus on positioning and client conversations, while this role ensures
              the system, materials, and documentation are always ready.

              I’ve gained strong exposure to presales and tender work, but I want to specialize in an enterprise software environment,

            </p>

              I see this as a progression into a role that emphasizes <strong>system readiness, demo enablement, and presales operations</strong>,

            <p>
              I can be very detail-oriented, especially when validating a system before a demo. To manage that, I use a
              <strong>time-boxed checklist</strong>: critical demo path first, then “nice-to-have” checks if time allows.
              That way I maintain quality without delaying delivery.

            <p><strong>Action:</strong> I isolated the fault by checking recent changes, logs, and dependencies, then applied a safe rollback/workaround to restore operations. After stabilization, I documented the root cause and added a monitoring/checklist step to detect it earlier next time.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Service restored with minimal downtime, and the preventive steps reduced repeat incidents.</p>

              Yes. In my current role, proposals and tender documentation must be accurate and compliant.

              I’m comfortable with creating clear visuals and mock screens to communicate workflows.
              If the tool is Adobe XD or Canva, I can adapt quickly—my approach is to focus on:
              layout clarity, user flow, labels, and how the screen supports the process being demonstrated.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal isn’t perfect UI artistry—it’s to help stakeholders visualize a solution clearly and fast.
