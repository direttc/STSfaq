      <h2>Tell me about yourself</h2>
      <p>
        My name is _________ and I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering.<br><br>

        I began my career as a Network QA Analyst at Celcom, where I focused on performance monitoring and structured data analysis to ensure nationwide service quality.<br><br>

        I later joined Astro Radio as an Operation Engineer, overseeing multiple stations and newsrooms. Beyond troubleshooting, I frequently designed practical solutions within operational constraints.<br><br>

        Currently, my core responsibility is designing tailored technical solutions for clients — whether through system integration, workflow redesign, or architectural adjustments. I engage stakeholders to understand business challenges, translate them into structured technical solutions, and validate them through Proof of Concept where required.<br><br>

        I am now looking to grow into a CRM-focused presales role where I can apply structured solution thinking, system validation discipline, and client-facing communication in an enterprise software environment.

            <ul>
              Currently, I’m working as a Solutions Executive where I conduct Proof of Concept (PoC) at client sites and design suitable solutions based on their requirements.<br>

              Before this, I worked as a Radio Operation Engineer and Network Quality Analyst in the telco industry, where I was responsible for system monitoring, performance analysis, and troubleshooting.<br>

              Through these roles, I’ve developed strong technical analysis skills, client communication experience, and documentation skills — which I believe align well with a presales and system validation role like this one.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
              From my understanding, this role supports the presales process by ensuring the system is properly configured, tested, and tailored to the prospect’s industry. It also involves preparing demo data, documenting meetings, assisting with tenders, and possibly designing UI mockups and demo materials.<br>

              It requires both technical understanding and strong organization skills to ensure smooth presales execution.

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <ul>
              While I may not have directly implemented CRM systems, my experience in solution design and PoC requires understanding user workflows, system integration, and data structure — which are core components of CRM systems. I’m also eager to deepen my CRM knowledge and quickly adapt to ORLIG’s platform.

            <ul>
              I’ve learned a lot in my current role, especially in technical validation and PoC work. However, I’m looking to move into a role that allows me to combine technical skills with more structured presales and solution positioning responsibilities. I see this opportunity as a natural progression rather than just a job change.

              Yes, definitely. In my current role, documentation is part of every PoC and technical validation process. I understand that clear documentation ensures alignment between teams and prevents miscommunication, especially in presales environments.
