          My name is _________ and I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering.<br><br>
          I started my career as network QA analyst at Celcom, where I do a lot of data analysis to ensure the network quality is at its best for Celcom users in entire Malaysia.<br><br>
          Later I got the opportunity to work at Astro Radio as Operation Engineer, where I oversee the operation for 13 radio stations and 8 news room.<br><br>
          This role is quite challenging because most of the time we were alone in dealing with users and we need to troubleshoot any issue arise in a very tight SLA.<br><br>
          In October 2023, everyone was offered a VSS by Astro and I took the opportunity to assist my parents with their family business due to their manpower constraint. I've managed to streamline operations, and now eager to return to a professional role and excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.<br>
